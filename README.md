# Pizza App

The repository for the Pizza App project!

---

## Description

The purpose of this project is to gain experience and become familiarized with React and Redux concepts for the 2023 winter learning circle for the developer apprenticeship at Automattic.

Led by our Automattician developer [Matt](https://github.com/mhsdef), [Synora](https://github.com/synora) and myself have been tasked with creating a React app to customize a pizza order.

The goal of the project will be to make use of a Redux store, customize a pizza order, and submit the order to a destination (kitchen, database, etc).

Once completed, we'll be able to deploy the app on GitHub as a demonstration of what we've learned!
